```{r random, echo=FALSE}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 2*x + rnorm(100)
cor(x, y)
```


```{r correlation, results="hide"}

y <- 2*x + rnorm(100)
cor(x, y)
```


```{r correlation2, include=FALSE}

## inline code
I know that $\pi$ value equals to `r pi`.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
